            <h4> Overview</h4>
            <p> My team was tasked with finding a Non-Profit website to redesign. We were drawn to Art Pride NJ for
                two reasons:
                they are great advocates for art programs in New Jersey and their art website was clearly lacking
                art. We wanted
                to design a website that would show off NJ artists and act as a hub for the art community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column">
            <h4> Role</h4>
            <p> User Research, Storyboarding, User Flows, Prototyping, and Testing</p>
            <h4> Timeframe</h4>
            <p> 3 Weeks</p>

            <h2>Research </h2>

            <p>Here are photos of the original homepage, which can be found at <a
                    href="artpridenj.org">Artpridenj.org:</a></p>


            <img src="/Images/Homepage HE.svg" class="img-fluid" style="width:400px;">

            <p>We began our research with <b>heuristic evaluation </b> of key pages of the website. On the homepage, we
                noted
                a lack of art, large chunks of text and whitespace, and a disorganized footer. </p>



            <p> Our next step was a <b>competitor’s analysis </b>to better understand how other sites in the arts
                advocacy
                space were designed. We choose Minnesota State Arts Board and Americans for the Arts (AA) as direct
                competitor as our group was most familiar with their work. Both sites were text-heavy, but AA had an
                alluring color scheme. Our indirect competitor was Visit NJ because they were not an arts advocacy site
                but they had an in-depth list of all art-related events in New Jersey. This allows community members to
                connect to the art scene.
            </p>
            <p>NJ Art Pride advocates in the government for more art funding and aims to increase attendance to art events 
                by connecting the public to the arts scene. While their advocacy work is up front and center, they don’t focus
                as much on the art scene they are advocating for.</p>
